I am an admirer of Openzeppelin, as a leader in cybersecurity that offers the most trusted open-source library 
that helps blockchain developers to build decentralized applications. This inspires me to join a team that helps 
the entire blockchain community to learn, innovate, and create a highly engaging environment.

It is with great interest that I submit my résumé for the Full Stack Ethereum Developer position with
Openzeppelin. I have had a variety of personal project that has provided me an expertise and knowledge about 
Smart Contract Development and Testing, Vulnerability Checking, and Front End integration. In the past 6 months,
I have built several Decentralized Applications including an NFT Marketplace, and an Off-Chain Voting
platform for my personal project, LennyVerse. Moreover, I was able to create a smart contract called "Community 
IDO, which helps developers to launch a decentralized project safely by controlling the liquidity released 
through time. I am a rigorous person that continues to expand my knowledge and always has a passion for 
learning. For this reason, I have self-taught myself several skills such as, the famous vulnerabilities that 
smart contracts could face and how to overcome problems with the help of Slither and MythX.

As a junior Data Scientist at the Development Bank of Canada, I learned how to communicate with all the members
of a team and make sure that each one of them understands the technology we are developing. Also during my 
experience at BDC, I participated into the development of several Machine and Deep Learning models and created 
the production pipeline to served them. I also was a teacher assistant for the class Advanced Topics in 
Information Systems in the MMA program at McGill, and this experience improved my capability to share my 
knowledge on complex topics.

I am confident that you will find me to be an exceptional and enthusiastic member of your team. I am eager to 
meet with you and discuss my achievements and how I can benefit your company and the entire blockchain 
industry. Please do not hesitate to contact me. Your consideration and response are very much appreciated.
